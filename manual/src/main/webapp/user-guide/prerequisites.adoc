The archive will be extracted to a directory named eclipse under the directory you specified (for e.g. $HOME/tools/eclipse/eclipse), referred to as *<eclipse_installation_dir>* from now on. 
Make sure that the JDK in the PATH is Sun JDK 6.0. 
Launch Eclipse by running <eclipse_installation_dir>/eclipse.

To install the Karaf, download the Karaf 2.2.x runtime from Apache Karaf downloads and extract the archive to a directory of your choice (for e.g.  $HOME/tools/karaf).

We will refer to this directory as *<karaf_installation_dir>* from now on.
